# Argonne National Lab ARM Atomspheric playground

Applying dev containers to the ARM code sounding-example.py.

### Steps to run in Github code spaces
[Open in code spaces](https://codespaces.new/SteveFroehlich/anl-arm)

Wait about 1 minute for the code space to spin up. Then wait for the pip
install to install the ARM specific libraries.

Open [sounding-example.py](sounding-example.py) then click the run (sideways triangle)
in the top right corner of the IDE.

The script should generate a png image named sounding.png. Open that file to view the result.
